Do I really have to fuxking spell out how to form team.
I miss the old days, we didn’t need rules, guidelines or even a teamfinder. You’d just DM the boys a pic of your feet and they knew it was time to rumble. You’d all kick off ya shoes, open a 12 pack shot gun two of them back instantly because otherwise you’ve got more beers than waves & no one could be bothered with math. Even the splits were simple, no one had to count to ungodly numbers above 10. The wave would start you’d recline back into your chair, start chatting shit with the boys ready to down a flock of penance into the floor with a dds. No one ever thought  to overstock, or stressed about what time when to reach a log. Fuck it took about half an hour just to finish stocking in the first place, just enough time to read through the heal codes you had on a post it note in the corner of your screen. Even though you knew them off by heart because every code was just 1-5-1-1. The defender only ever staggered up outta the chair to take a piss waiting for your 90s healer reserve on wave 7. And the healer was the most sociable role, only ever spamming war chants as you’d skip over to the west side every wave 6+ to refresh the Bandos boys with another round of the old vial. And none of this dps coll shit, looking like a stripper in a skirt or some elf costume. They were chilling in their finest armour because they’d just spent about 6 minutes being tag teamed by the 12 reserves still alive on wave 3, slamming back a couple extra bourbon shots than the rest of the boys because they only had to pick up eggs for 4 waves to make points with all the vials. 90 minutes later you’re all hammered and you can’t remember anything other than you had a good time. That was customer 2/3 for the day but you’d made enough to buy a brand new mustang so you called it a day & went to spin your flax for 9 crafting. 

Everyone all about this sweaty duolog stuff lately & “sub 17s” but where’s the community, the spirit & the fkn brews






What the heck did you just fricking say about me, you little torso hunter? Ill have you know I passed all my trials in BA Services, and I’ve been involved in numerous leeches, and I have over 300 confirmed high gambles. I am trained in overstock healing and I’m the top healer in the entire Speed running community. You are nothing to me but just another torso hunter. I will wipe you the frick out with speed runs the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet? Think again, you mid-runner. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of wave 1 line dancers and our dance is being prepared right now, so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out your pathetic little player from wave 1. You’re fricking dead, kid. I can be any role, at any time and I can kill runners in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with the west trap. Not only am I extensively trained in one-egging, but I have access to the entire arsenal of animation delay items and I will use it to its full extent to delay your games for eternity, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fricking penance horn, but you couldn’t, you didn’t, you called the wrong attack style and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fricking dead kiddo.

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom

Sometimes I scribble addresses, too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
